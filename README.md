# Sorting Algorithms

## Assignment:

Rewrite Radix Sort to recursively call RadixSort() instead of countingSort() as its sorting algorithm.

* You may use the code provided in this repository as a starting point.
* You may choose to edit radix.py or copy the contents into a new file. either way, let me know which is your final submission.
* [Document](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) your code and use [modular programming](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/#executing-a-module-as-a-script) to maximise the quality of your code.
* Aswin will cover the RadixSort algorithm in the lab so if you didn't quite follow today, then you will have another chance at it during the week.

## Additional Notes

* Please do not double-submit. If you are part of a group, do not submit a separate assignment as well.
* List your group members in the README file or in the header for your submission.
* Submit by May 8 at 12 am.
